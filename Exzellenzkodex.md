# Exzellenzkodex

Be excellent to each other.

**ALL CREATURES WELCOME!**
The Chaos Computer Club is a galactic organization that welcomes all life-forms.
As such, we are dedicated to providing a safe, secure and enjoyable experience for everybody â€“ regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, origin, or physical appearance.

**BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER!**
We stand for freedom of expression, but will not condone any form of sexism, group-focused enmity, violence or harassment.
Lifeforms who refuse to share this open- ness towards others are not welcome at our events.

**PLEASE RESPECT!**
Always wash your hands. Again, please.
Before you take a picture,
please ask everybody for consent.
Sorry, but smoking is absolutely prohibited in all indoor areas

**I've heard about people being harassed at tech cons. Do I need to worry?**
* Generally, the Congress is a safe and friendly place, and the vast majority of attendants knows how to behave. If you run into someone who doesn't and can't resolve the problem yourself or with the help of other attendants, don't hesitate to contact the security angel, either directly by calling 110 on DECT, or by asking any of the volunteers to do this for you. Safety and Security on 34C3 for more details.

**What about videotaping/taking pictures at congress?**
Ask everybody in the picture if they agree to be photographed or filmed.
It follows that shots from the stage into the audience and long shots in the hack center and the other public areas are not possible! Please note that we might ask photographers and film teams to leave if they don't behave accordingly.
