# Exzellenzkodex

Be excellent to each other.

ALL CREATURES WELCOME!
The Chaos Computer Club is a galactic organization that welcomes all life-forms.
As such, we are dedicated to providing a safe, secure and enjoyable experience for everybody â€“ regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, origin, or physical appearance.

BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER!
We stand for freedom of expression, but will not condone any form of sexism, group-focused enmity, violence or harassment.
Lifeforms who refuse to share this open- ness towards others are not welcome at our events.

PLEASE RESPECT!
Always wash your hands. Again, please.
Before you take a picture,
please ask everybody for consent.
Sorry, but smoking is absolutely prohibited in all indoor areas
